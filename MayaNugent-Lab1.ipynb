For example, if we could test our code on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd pyramid numbers, we have something to compare with.  So, instead of hard-wiring our code to calculate the 10th pyramid number, we should create a variable (let's call it N here) which represents which pyramid number we're calculating.  When N = 10, we should get the same result.  When N = 1, we should get 1, N = 2 yields 5 and N = 3 yields 14.  So, rewrite your code where the first line is N = 10, as is started for you in the cell below.  Change your code until it agrees with your previous code when N = 10, and agrees with the known values for N = 1, 2 and 3 (i.e., once your code seems to work for N = 10, change that first line for N = 1, re-run and make sure you get 1, etc.)."
